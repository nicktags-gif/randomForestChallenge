## 🎯 Note on Python Usage

You have not been coached through setting up a Python environment.  **If using Python** You will need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary packages to run this code - takes about 15 minutes; see [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).  Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.  You can see the executed Python output at my GitHub pages site: [https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/](https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/).

:::

## The Problem: Can Many Weak Learners Beat One Strong Learner?

**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?

**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are "weak learners" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a "strong learner" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?

**Our Approach:** We'll compare random forests with different numbers of trees against linear regression and individual decision trees to understand the trade-offs between complexity and performance **for this dataset**.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Data and Methodology

We analyze the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Anticipated Non-linear Relationships:** Real estate prices have complex, non-linear relationships between features (e.g., square footage in wealthy vs. poor zip codes affects price differently)
- **Mixed Data Types:** Contains both categorical (zipCode) and numerical variables
- **Real-world Complexity:** Captures the kind of messy, real-world data where ensemble methods excel

Since we anticipate non-linear relationships, random forests are well-suited to model the relationship between features and sale price.

## Student Analysis Section: The Power of More Trees {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Create visualizations and analysis to demonstrate the power of ensemble learning. You'll need to create three key components:

### 1. The Power of More Trees Visualization

**Create a visualization showing:**
- RMSE vs Number of Trees (both training and test data)
- R-squared vs Number of Trees
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization

```{python}
#| label: trees-performance-viz
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 8

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Calculate R-squared for training data
r2_1_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_1_train)
r2_5_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_5_train)
r2_25_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_25_train)
r2_100_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_100_train)
r2_500_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_500_train)
r2_1000_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_1000_train)
r2_2000_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_2000_train)
r2_5000_train = r2_score(y_train, predictions_5000_train)

# Create figure with two subplots
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 6))

# Plot 1: RMSE vs Number of Trees
trees = [1, 5, 25, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
rmse_test = [rmse_1_test, rmse_5_test, rmse_25_test, rmse_100_test, rmse_500_test, rmse_1000_test, rmse_2000_test, rmse_5000_test]
rmse_train = [rmse_1_train, rmse_5_train, rmse_25_train, rmse_100_train, rmse_500_train, rmse_1000_train, rmse_2000_train, rmse_5000_train]

ax1.semilogx(trees, rmse_test, 'o-', label='Test Data', linewidth=2, markersize=6, color='red')
ax1.semilogx(trees, rmse_train, 's-', label='Training Data', linewidth=2, markersize=6, color='blue')
ax1.set_xlabel('Number of Trees (log scale)')
ax1.set_ylabel('RMSE')
ax1.set_title('RMSE vs Number of Trees')
ax1.legend()
ax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Plot 2: R-squared vs Number of Trees
r2_test = [r2_1, r2_5, r2_25, r2_100, r2_500, r2_1000, r2_2000, r2_5000]
r2_train = [r2_1_train, r2_5_train, r2_25_train, r2_100_train, r2_500_train, r2_1000_train, r2_2000_train, r2_5000_train]

ax2.semilogx(trees, r2_test, 'o-', label='Test Data', linewidth=2, markersize=6, color='red')
ax2.semilogx(trees, r2_train, 's-', label='Training Data', linewidth=2, markersize=6, color='blue')
ax2.set_xlabel('Number of Trees (log scale)')
ax2.set_ylabel('R-squared')
ax2.set_title('R-squared vs Number of Trees')
ax2.legend()
ax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Add Brief Discussion of the Visualization**
- Discuss where the most dramatic improvement in performance occurs as you add more trees, how dramatic is it?
- Discuss diminishing returns as you add more trees

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Visualization Requirements

Create two plots:
1. **RMSE Plot:** Show how RMSE decreases with more trees (both training and test)
2. **R-squared Plot:** Show how R-squared increases with more trees

Use log scale on x-axis to better show the relationship across the range of tree counts.
:::

# We can see that the most dramatic improvement was in the early stage of the ensemble learning process. Specifically within the less than 100 trees range. This is where we see steep declines in RMSE and rapid increases in R-squared. This happens because trees make many errors and as we start to see the trees learn from each other, the errors cancel out and the model becomes more accurate.
# We see diminishing returns as we increase the amount of trees, this is shown by where the line start to plateau. This indicates that adding more trees past a certain point does not significantly improve the model's performance. This may be happening for many different reasons as it could be due to limited data diversity, or a models "theoretical limit". 

### 2. Overfitting Visualization and Analysis

**Your Task:** Compare decision trees vs random forests in terms of overfitting.

**Create one visualization with two side-by-side plots showing:**
- Decision trees: How performance changes with tree complexity (max depth)
- Random forests: How performance changes with number of trees

**Your analysis should explain:**
- Why individual decision trees overfit as they become more complex
- Why random forests don't suffer from the same overfitting problem
- The mechanisms that prevent overfitting in random forests (bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, averaging)


::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Overfitting Analysis Requirements

Create a side-by-side comparison showing:
1. **Decision Trees:** Training vs Test RMSE as max depth increases (showing overfitting)
2. **Random Forests:** Training vs Test RMSE as number of trees increases (no overfitting)

- Use the same y-axis limits for both side-by-side plots so it clearly shows whether random forests outperform decision trees.
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization
:::

# The problem with overfitting in decision trees is that Training RMSE continuously decreases and Test RMSE continuously increases, then decreases. Creating a big gap between Training and Test performance. This happens because individual trees are highly sensitive to small changes in the training data. Also because complex trees can create rules that work perfectly on the training data but not on the test data. Deep trees can also easily get thrown off by noise in the training data. 
# Random forests don't suffer from the same overfitting problem because they are an ensemble of trees. This means that the errors of the trees cancel out and the model becomes more accurate. This is because the trees are trained on different subsets of the data and the errors of the trees cancel out. This is also because the trees are trained on different features and the errors of the trees cancel out.
# There are three main mechanisms that prevent overfitting in random forests, bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, and averaging. Bootstrap sampling is a technique that allows the model to see more of the data by sampling with replacement. Random feature selection is a technique that allows the model to see more of the features by randomly selecting features. Averaging is a technique that allows the model to see more of the data by averaging the predictions of the trees.

dt_rmse_test = []

for depth in max_depths:
    dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=depth, random_state=123)

    dt_pred_test = dt.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate RMSE
    dt_rmse_train.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, dt_pred_train)))

# Set the same y-axis limits for both plots for easy comparison
y_min = min(min(dt_rmse_train), min(dt_rmse_test), min(rf_rmse_train), min(rf_rmse_test))
y_max = max(max(dt_rmse_train), max(dt_rmse_test), max(rf_rmse_train), max(rf_rmse_test))
y_range = y_max - y_min
y_min -= y_range * 0.05  # Add 5% padding
y_max += y_range * 0.05

ax1.set_ylim(y_min, y_max)
ax2.set_ylim(y_min, y_max)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

### 3. Linear Regression vs Random Forest Comparison

**Your Task:** Compare random forests to linear regression baseline.

**Create a comparison table showing:**
- Linear Regression RMSE
- Random Forest (1 tree) RMSE  
- Random Forest (100 trees) RMSE
- Random Forest (1000 trees) RMSE

**Your analysis should address:**
- The improvement in RMSE when going from 1 tree to 100 trees
- Whether switching from linear regression to 100-tree random forest shows similar improvement
- When random forests are worth the added complexity vs linear regression
- The trade-offs between interpretability and performance

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Comparison Requirements

Create a clear table comparing:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest (1 tree)
- Random Forest (100 trees) 
- Random Forest (1000 trees)

Include percentage improvements over linear regression for each random forest model.
